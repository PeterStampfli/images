Help for the waves application
</h1>

<div class="vSpace"> </div>


<p>
This app transforms your images into quasiperiodic wallpapers using symmetric packages of waves as proposed by Frank Farris.<br>
It does its work only on <em>your computer</em> and your images stay on your computer. No data will be transferred.
</p>


<div class="vSpace"> </div>

    
<h1>Output image</h1>
<p>
At the left you see the output image. First, you see only the structure of the waves.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Use the control panel at the lower right side to open an input image!</strong>
</p>

<p>
Drag with the mouse or touch to change the visible part of the output image. Turn the mouse wheel, use two finger touch or type "Z" or "z" to zoom in or out. 
</p>

<div class="vSpace"> </div>

<h1>Control panel</h1>
<p>
In the lower part of the right hand side you find a control panel.
</p>
<p>
Use it to <strong>open an input image</strong> ! 
</p>

<p>
Once you have opened an input image you can switch between <strong>showing</strong> the transformed quasiperiodic image or the structure of the waves that define the transformation.
</p>

<p>
You can choose between those <strong>rotational symmetries</strong> that give nice quasiperiodic images.
</p>

<p>
You can choose <strong>color symmetries</strong>. Single color symmetry does not change the colors of the image upon an elementary rotation. For two color symmetry the colors invert. For 5-fold rotational symmetry you get only single color symmetry.

<p>
You can display a  <strong>reference tiling</strong> fitted to the image. You may thus better see the structure of quasiperiodic images. Choose a colour that makes it visible. 
For 5, 8 and 12-fold rotational symmetry you get a patch of a <strong>quasiperiodic tiling</strong>. Examine how tiles of the same shape have similar decorations. For other 10-fold symmetry you only see a rosette.<br>
<strong> Note that drawing a large tiling patch slows down everything !</strong>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Save the output image</strong> as a png. You will find it in the download folder as "kaleidoscope.png"
</p>

<p>
<strong>Choose the output image width and height</strong>. Only the resolution changes and you will always get the same overall image. Large sizes will take a lot of time and the computer can become unresponsive for several minutes. <em>Be patient</em>. Maximum side length is 10'000 pixels, giving an image of 100 megapixel. The browser then would need nearly 2 gigabytes of memory for the image data.
</p>

<p>
<strong>To see hidden image parts lying outside the window use the scroll bars.</strong> Using scroll bars does not change the image and is reasonably fast. If you drag or zoom the image with the mouse, then you <em>change</em> the image and this becomes very slow for large images. 
</p>

<h1>Input image</h1>

<p>
You see it in the upper right for landscape and in the lower left for portrait orientation. It may be partially covered by the control panel. To bring it to the foreground click or touch it. At the same time a dark disc with an arrow will appear. Click or touch remaining parts of the control panel to bring it back to the foreground.
</p>
<p>
Pixels of the input image appearing in the output image are shown in full color. Unused pixels are faded out.
</p>
<p>
Drag with the mouse or touch to shift the position of sampled pixels. With the mouse wheel or the "Z" and "z" keys you can change the size of the sampled region. With two finger touch you can zoom and rotate.
</p>
<p>
Dragging the mouse or touch on the disc with the arrow zooms and rotates the sampled region of the input image. Turning the mouse wheel or touching the "Z" and "z" keys only rotates.
