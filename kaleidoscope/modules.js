// aggregator
// import all from a common source
//===================================================

// NOTE: put dependencies in correct order
// what has to bb done loaded first has to be first

// seems that at first import of something here, all files are loaded in sequence

// so with modules that "export" global objects with
// window.something=something
// then this something does not needed to be loaded anywhere
// it is everythere present (after importing from this)
// has it to be the lowest export of all of them here?

// better not rely on this

// do not create globals without good cause
