Note: transition weights not need to be integer. But is is easiest to use unit weights for new connections.
To partially forget old texts, we can multiply all transition weights by a small factor < 1 !!

For indexing words:
===================		
Finding index starts with empty word at index 0

					            wordIndex
					                |
					                |
				  		            V
words = 			[ ... , word as String , ...]
         													      char
																	|
wordsMoreChars =    [ ... , moreChars as String, ....]				|
																	V
							moreChars = '      ..          ..     char    ............'
																	|
wordsMoreWords =    [ ... , moreWords as Integer Array, ....]		|  (indexOf)
																	V
							moreWords = [    ...         ,  index to words, ....]
							                                        |
							                                        V
							                                   wordIndex

For transitions from a single word to a new word:
=================================================
Text always starts with dummy word with index 0, empty text

					            wordIndex
					                |
					                |
				  		            V
wordsTransitionWeights =  [  .... , transitionWeights as Integer Array , ....]			
									
                     									transitionWeights = [ ... , weight , .....]
                     																	|
wordsTransitionSums =  [  .... , transitionSum as Integer , ....]	--> transitionSum ->|<-- random number
																						|  ^ 
wordsTransitionIndices =  [  .... , transitionIndices as Integer Array , ....]			|  | (indexOf)
																						V  |
                     									transitionIndices = [ ... , nextWordIndex , .....]
                     																    |  ^ 
												                                        V  |
												                                   nextWordIndex

For transitions from a pair of words to a new word:
===================================================

first get a unique index for word pairs from firstWordIndex and secondWordIndex

word pairs are similar as word transitions

wordsSecondWords === wordTransitionIndices

							        firstWordIndex
					      		          |
								          |						         		second word index
							  		      V												|
wordsSecondWords =  	[  .... , secondWords as Integer Array , ....]					|
										  |												|
										  |												V
                     					  |				secondWords = [ ... , index to words , .....]
                     					  |											    |
										  V		                                        |  (indexOf)
wordsPairIndices=  		[  .... , pairIndices as Integer Array , ....]					|
																						V
                                                       pairIndices = [ ...   , index to pairs , ...]
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        V
                                                                                   pairIndex

Note that there is no array for the word pairs themselves needed if we only 
make transitions from pairs to words as output comes from the words array ...

If we want transitions between pairs we can store info for one pair in a single integer:
maximum safe integer: 9007199254740991
maximum number of words : 100'000
info = firstWord*100'000+secondWord is safe

We need only info for transitions, which can be organized as for the single word to word transition.

(Note: log size of arrays to see if we run out of memory.)


For transitions from a word pair to a new word:
=================================================
start with pair at index 0, is a pair with both word empty at index zero

pairsTransitionWeights =  [  .... , transitionWeights as Integer Array , ....]			
									
                     									transitionWeights = [ ... , weight , .....]
                     																	|
pairsTransitionSums =  [  .... , transitionSum as Integer , ....]	--> transitionSum ->|<-- random number
																						|  ^ 
pairsTransitionIndizes =  [  .... , transitionIndizes as Integer Array , ....]			|  | (indexOf)
																						V  |
                     									transitionIndizes = [ ... , nextWordIndex , .....]
                     																    |  ^ 
												                                        V  |
												                                   nextWordIndex
