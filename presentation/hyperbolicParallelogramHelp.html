<h1>
Help for the "hyperbolic Parallelogram" application
</h1>

<div class="vSpace"> </div>


<p>
This app does its work only on <em>your computer</em> and your images stay on your computer. No data will be transferred.<br>
It makes tilings of hyperbolic space using a parallelogram and its morror image.
</p>


<div class="vSpace"> </div>

    
<h1>Output image</h1>
<p>
At the left you see the output image. It first shows only its structure. The white lines show the generating lines and circles. They are borders of the basic parallelogram. Repeated mirror images at the straight lines and inversions in the circles generate a tiling.<br>
The yellowish disc is a Poincaré disc representation of hyperbolic space with a tiling:
</p>
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>bright yellow</td> <td>-</td> <td>The basic parallelogram</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>brown</td><td>-</td> <td>Mirror images of the basic parallelogram</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>darkened yellow</td><td>-</td> <td>Translated copies of the basic parallelogram</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>
<p>
Outside you see an inverted Poincaré disc:
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>bright blue</td> <td>-</td> <td>The basic parallelogram, one corner lies at infinity.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>dark blue</td><td>-</td> <td>Mirror images of the basic parallelogram</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>blue</td><td>-</td> <td>Translated copies of the basic parallelogram</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Use the control panel at the right side to open an input image!</strong><br>
    It decorates the tiling of the yellow Poincaré disc. The outside is decorated with the same image but using inverted hues.
</p>
<p>
Drag with the mouse or touch to change the visible part of the output image. Turn the mouse wheel, use two finger touch or type "Z" or "z" to zoom in or out. You always see exactly the pixels of the generated output image. Dragging and zooming really modifies the image and does not merely change its view. This might take some time.
</p>




<div class="vSpace"> </div>

<h1>Control panel</h1>
<p>
In the lower part of the right hand side you find a control panel.
</p>
<p>
Use it to open an input image or to switch between showing the structure of the kaleidoscope or a kaleidoscopic image.
</p>
<p>
<strong> You can choose what you will see:</strong> <br>
"structure" shows simply the tiling.<br>
"image" maps an input image like a skin on the tiling.<br>
"convergence" shows the points that need a lot of inversions in the circles to get mapped into the basic parallelogram. More inversions give a lighter color. The number of inversions diverges at the boundary of the Poincaré disc.
</p>

<p>
<strong> You can choose if you want to show the lines and circles that generate the image.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong> You can choose the rotational symmetries:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>center</td> <td>-</td> <td>Rotational symmetry at the <em>center</em> of the image.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>upper</td><td>-</td> <td>Symmetry at the intersection between the upper circle and straight line</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>middle</td><td>-</td> <td>Symmetry at the intersection between the two circles</td>
            </tr><tr>
            <td>lower</td><td>-</td> <td>Symmetry at the intersection between the lower circle and straight line</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>You can choose the size of the upper circle.</strong> Using a value of 1 gives maximum size such that it touches the lower line and the parallelogram becomes a triangle. Using a value of 0 makes that the upper circle vanishes and we get a triangle too.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>You can save the output image</strong> as a png. You will find it in the download folder as "kaleidoscope.png"
</p>

<p>
<strong>You can choose the output image size</strong>. Only the resolution changes and you will always get the same overall image. Large sizes will take a lot of time and the computer can become unresponsive for several minutes. <em>Be patient</em>. Maximum side length is 10'000 pixels, giving an image of 100 megapixel. The browser then would need nearly 2 gigabytes of memory for the image and structure data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To see hidden image parts lying outside the window use the scroll bars.</strong> Using scroll bars does not change the image and is reasonably fast. If you drag or zoom the image with the mouse then you <em>change</em> the image and this becomes very slow for large images. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Choose the image quality:</strong>
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>low</td> <td>-</td> <td>Uses nearest neighbor sampling. Very fast, for exploration only. Switch to higher quality before saving an image. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>high</td><td>-</td> <td>Uses anti-aliasing and linear interpolation. Suitable for most cases.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>very&nbsphigh</td><td>-</td> <td>Uses anti-aliasing and cubic interpolation. Very slow. Use only if linear interpolation leaves artificial bright and dark lines.</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>
</p>

<h1>Input image</h1>

<p>
Once you open an input image you will see it in the upper right. It may be partially covered by the control panel. To bring it to the foreground click or touch it. At the same time a dark disc with an arrow will appear. Click or touch remaining parts of the control panel to bring it back to the foreground.
</p>
<p>
Pixels of the input image appearing in the output image are shown in full color. Unused pixels are faded out.
</p>
<p>
Drag with the mouse or touch to shift the position of sampled pixels. With the mouse wheel or the "Z" and "z" keys you can change the size of the sampled region. With two finger touch you can zoom and rotate.
</p>
<p>
Dragging the mouse or touch on the disc with the arrow zooms and rotates the sampled region of the input image. Turning the mouse wheel or touching the "Z" and "z" keys only rotates.
