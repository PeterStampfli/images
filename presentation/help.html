Help for the Kaleidoscope application

    <h1>Output image</h1>
<p>
At the left you see the output image. It first shows only its structure:
</p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>yellow</td> <td>-</td> <td>The basic triangle</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>green</td><td>-</td> <td>Mirror images of the basic triangle or parts of it</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>brown</td><td>-</td> <td>Copies of the basic triangle or parts of it</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Use the control panel at the right side to open an input image!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Drag with the mouse to change the visible part of the image. Turn the mouse wheel or type "Z" or "z" to zoom in or out. You always see exactly the pixels of the generated output image. Dragging and zooming really modifies the image and does not merely change its view.
</p>
<div class="vSpace"> </div>

<h1>Control panel</h1>
<p>
In the lower part of the right hand side you find a control panel.
</p>
<p>
Use it to open an input image or to switch between showing the structure of the kaleidoscope or a kaleidoscopic image.
</p>
<p>
You can choose the <strong>rotational symmetries</strong>:
</p>
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>center</td> <td>-</td> <td>Rotational symmetry at the <em>center</em> of the image.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>left</td><td>-</td> <td>Symmetry at the <em>left</em> hand corner of the basic triangle (seen from center and for regular tilings.)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>right</td><td>-</td> <td>Symmetry at the <em>right</em> hand corner of the basic triangle (seen from center and for regular tilings.)</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>

<p>
You can choose the <strong>tiling type</strong>:
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>regular</td> <td>-</td> <td>The image is a decoration of a <em>regular tiling</em> by one regular polygon.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>semireg. 1</td><td>-</td> <td>The image is a decoration of a semiregular tiling using two different regular polygons such as the tiling by <em>octagons</em> and squares.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>semireg. 2</td><td>-</td> <td>The image is a decoration of a semiregular tiling using two different regular polygons such as the tiling by <em>hexagons</em> and equilateral triangles.</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>
<p>
Note that the usual kaleidoscopes with mirrors only give images of regular tilings.
</p>

<p>
You can <strong>save the output image</strong> as a png. You will find it in the download folder as "kaleidoscope.png"
</p>

<p>
You can choose the <strong>output image size</strong>. Maximum is 10000 pixels. Only the resolution changes and you will always get the same image. To see hidden image parts lying outside the window use the scroll bars. Using scroll bars does not change the image and is fast. Dragging the image with the mouse <em>changes</em> the image and is slow. Large sizes will take a lot of time and the computer can be unresponsive for several minutes. Be patient.
</p>

<p>
Choose the <strong>image quality</strong>.
<p>
    <table>
            <tr>
            <td>low</td> <td>-</td> <td>Uses nearest neighbor sampling. Very fast, for exploration only. Switch to higher quality before saving an image. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>high</td><td>-</td> <td>Uses anti-aliasing and linear interpolation. Suitable for most cases.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>very high</td><td>-</td> <td>Uses anti-aliasing and cubic interpolation. Very slow. Use only if pixels if linear interpolation creates artificial bright and dark lines.</td>
            </tr>
    </table>
</p>
</p>

<h1>Input image</h1>

<p>
Once you open an input image you will see it in the upper right. It may be partially covered by the control panel. To bring it to the foreground click on it. At the same time a dark disc with an arrow appears.
</p>
<p>
Pixels of the input image that appear in the output image are shown in full color. Unused pixels are greyed out.
</p>
<p>
Drag with the mouse to shift the position of sampled pixels. With the mouse wheel or the "Z" and "z" keys you can change the size of the sampled region.
</p>
<p>
Dragging the mouse on the disc with the arrow or turning the mouse wheel or touching the "Z" and "z" keys rotates the sampled region.
</p>
