Help for the two circles application
</h1>

<div class="vSpace"> </div>


<p>
This app does its work only on <em>your computer</em> and your images stay on your computer. No data will be transferred.
</p>

    <h1>Output image</h1>
<p>
At the left you see the output image. 
</p>

<p>
Drag with the mouse or touch to change the visible part of the output image. Turn the mouse wheel, use two finger touch or type "Z" or "z" to zoom in or out. 
</p>
<div class="vSpace"> </div>

<h1>Control panel</h1>
<p>
In the lower part of the right hand side you find a control panel.
</p>
<p>
Use it to open another input image. 


</p>

<p>
You can select the <strong>view</strong>. The app opens using the direct view.
</p>

<p>
Direct view: Part of the input image is shown without distortion inside the intersection region of the two blue circles. Outside this region we see what is inside, but inverted in the two circles. Multiple inversions are possible. Note that close to the two intersection points
</p>

<p>
Circle inversion view: Shows the same as the direct view, but inverted in the red circle. The center of the red circle lies on an intersection of the two blue circles. Inversion in the red circle maps the blue circle onto the straight orange line. Thus inversion in the blue circle becomes a mirror image at the straight line.
</p>

<p>
You can choose the <strong>rotational symmetry</strong> generated by the two inverting circles.
</p>

<p>
You can choose the relative sizes of the two circles.

<p>
 <strong>Save the output image</strong> as a png. You will find it in the download folder as "kaleidoscope.png"
</p>

<p>
<strong>Choose the output image size</strong>. Only the resolution changes and you will always get the same overall image. 
</p>


<h1>Input image</h1>

<p>
You see it in the upper right for landscape and in the lower left for pportrait orientation. It may be partially covered by the control panel. To bring it to the foreground click or touch it. At the same time a dark disc with an arrow will appear. Click or touch remaining parts of the control panel to bring it back to the foreground.
</p>
<p>
Pixels of the input image appearing in the output image are shown in full color. Unused pixels are faded out.
</p>
<p>
Drag with the mouse or touch to shift the position of sampled pixels. With the mouse wheel or the "Z" and "z" keys you can change the size of the sampled region. With two finger touch you can zoom and rotate.
</p>
<p>
Dragging the mouse or touch on the disc with the arrow zooms and rotates the sampled region of the input image. Turning the mouse wheel or touching the "Z" and "z" keys only rotates.
